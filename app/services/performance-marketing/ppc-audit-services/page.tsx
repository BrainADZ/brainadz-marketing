const FAQS = [
  {
    question: "What is included in a PPC audit?",

      "A PPC audit can include account structure, keywords, search terms, audiences, locations, placements, ads, creative, bidding, budgets, conversion tracking, landing pages, lead quality, revenue quality and reporting. The exact scope depends on the platforms and business model.",
  },
  {
    question: "Which platforms can you audit?",
    answer:
      "We can audit Google Ads, Meta Ads, LinkedIn Ads and cross-channel paid media programmes. Platform coverage is confirmed before the audit begins.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you make changes during the audit?",
    answer:
      "The standard audit focuses on analysis and recommendations. Critical changes can be implemented separately when requested and when account access, ownership and risk are clear.",
  },
  {
    question: "How much historical data is needed?",
    answer:
      "The useful period depends on spend, conversion volume, seasonality and recent account changes. We generally review enough history to identify stable patterns while separating unusual promotional or migration periods.",
  },
  {
    question: "Will you audit conversion tracking?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Conversion definitions, tags, values, duplicate events, primary and secondary actions, CRM feedback and reporting consistency are central parts of the audit.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can you audit lead quality?",
    answer:
      "Yes, when lead or CRM data is available. We can compare platform conversions with valid, qualified, disqualified, opportunity and customer outcomes.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you provide a written action plan?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Findings are prioritised by urgency, expected impact, implementation effort and ownership so the business can act in a practical sequence.",
  },
  {
    question: "Does every PPC account need to be rebuilt?",
    answer:
      "No. Many accounts can improve through targeted corrections. A rebuild is recommended only when the existing structure prevents control, measurement or responsible optimisation.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can the audit include landing pages?",
    answer:
      "Yes. We can review message match, mobile UX, forms, trust, conversion friction and tracking on the pages used by paid campaigns.",
  },
  {
    question: "Does a PPC audit guarantee better performance?",
    answer:
      "No audit can guarantee a fixed result. It identifies evidence-based risks and opportunities. Improvement still depends on implementation quality, market conditions, budget, offer, creative, tracking and sales or ecommerce operations.",
