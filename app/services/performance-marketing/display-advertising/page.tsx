  },
  {
    question: "Where can Google Display ads appear?",
    answer:
      "Display campaigns can serve across eligible websites, apps and Google-owned properties supported by the Google Display Network and campaign settings. Actual inventory depends on targeting, exclusions, assets, geography and account eligibility.",
  },
  {
    question: "What are responsive display ads?",
    answer:
      "Responsive display ads use uploaded assets such as images, logos, headlines, descriptions and optional videos. Google automatically combines and adapts eligible assets to fit available ad spaces.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can you use fixed banner designs?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Uploaded display ads can be used when fixed creative control is required and the format meets Google Ads specifications. Responsive ads are usually included to expand inventory coverage.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is optimized targeting?",
    answer:
      "Optimized targeting allows Google to look beyond manually selected audience signals to find additional users likely to meet the campaign goal. The original audiences and keywords act as starting signals rather than strict limits.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can Display Ads target specific websites or apps?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Managed placements can target selected websites, apps, videos or channels where supported. Campaigns can also use audience or contextual targeting that leads to automatic placements.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do you control unsuitable placements?",
    answer:
      "We use placement reporting, placement exclusions, content exclusions, inventory controls and account-level or campaign-level suitability settings according to brand and performance requirements.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can you limit how often someone sees a Display ad?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Frequency caps can limit impressions for an individual user at campaign, ad-group or ad level over a daily, weekly or monthly period, subject to current Google Ads functionality.",
  },
  {
    question: "Are Display Ads useful for lead generation?",
    answer:
      "Display can generate leads, but performance depends on the audience, offer, creative, landing page, bidding and conversion signal. It is also commonly used for awareness, consideration and remarketing support.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you guarantee a fixed number of impressions or conversions?",
    answer:
      "No responsible Display Ads provider can guarantee fixed business outcomes. Delivery and performance depend on audience size, inventory, competition, budget, creative, tracking and conversion experience. We provide transparent optimisation around agreed goals.",
