const FAQS = [

      "The service can include Merchant Center setup or review, product feed optimisation, Standard Shopping, Performance Max retail campaigns, product segmentation, bidding, budgets, promotions, purchase tracking, optimisation and reporting.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need Google Merchant Center for Shopping ads?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Retailers need product information in Google Merchant Center and must link the relevant Merchant Center and Google Ads accounts before running Shopping or retail Performance Max campaigns.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the difference between Standard Shopping and Performance Max?",
    answer:
      "Standard Shopping provides more direct campaign, product-group and bidding control within Shopping inventory. Performance Max uses Merchant Center products with broader Google channel automation and optimises using goals, assets, audience inputs and conversion data.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do Shopping ads use keywords?",
    answer:
      "Shopping ads primarily use Merchant Center product attributes and campaign settings rather than keyword targeting. Search terms and negative keyword controls can still provide important insight and control depending on campaign type.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you optimise product feeds?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Feed work can include titles, descriptions, categories, product types, identifiers, variants, images, price, availability and custom labels, together with Merchant Center diagnostics and policy issues.",
  },
  {
    question: "What are custom labels?",
    answer:
      "Custom labels are optional feed attributes that retailers can use to group products by business-defined categories such as margin, season, bestseller status, price band or clearance. They support campaign segmentation and reporting.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can Shopping ads promote local store inventory?",
    answer:
      "Eligible retailers can use local inventory data and supported campaign setups to promote products available in physical stores. Merchant Center, store information, inventory data and policy requirements must all be configured correctly.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do you measure Shopping campaign performance?",
    answer:
      "Measurement can include product impressions, clicks, cost, orders, revenue, conversion value, ROAS, average order value, new customers, stock, product-group contribution and available profitability context.",
  },
  {
    question: "How quickly can Google Shopping Ads generate sales?",
    answer:
      "Campaigns can begin generating product traffic and orders after approval and launch, but stable performance requires enough demand and conversion data. Results depend on product competitiveness, pricing, feed quality, stock, website experience, budget and measurement.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you guarantee a specific ROAS or revenue?",
    answer:
      "No responsible Shopping Ads provider can guarantee fixed results because performance depends on demand, competition, price, stock, margin, feed quality, website conversion, tracking and budget. We provide transparent optimisation around agreed commercial goals.",
