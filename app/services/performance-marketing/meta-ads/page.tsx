const FAQS = [
  {
    question: "What is included in your Meta Ads service?",
    answer:
      "The service can include campaign strategy, objective selection, audience planning, creative briefs, Facebook and Instagram ad setup, Pixel and Conversions API measurement, lead or sales quality review, ongoing optimisation and reporting. The final scope depends on the campaign goal and available creative and tracking infrastructure.",
  },
  {
    question: "Which Meta Ads objectives do you manage?",
    answer:
      "We can manage awareness, traffic, engagement, leads and sales campaigns. The selected objective, conversion location and performance goal are matched with the business outcome instead of choosing an objective only because it produces a low platform cost.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do Meta Ads include both Facebook and Instagram?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Campaigns can deliver across eligible Meta placements including Facebook and Instagram. Creative is prepared for the placements and formats most relevant to the campaign, such as feeds, Stories and Reels.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you create Meta ad creatives?",
    answer:
      "The service can include creative strategy, copy, static designs, short-form video briefs and placement adaptations. The production scope is agreed according to the number of concepts, formats and monthly testing requirements.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is Advantage+ audience?",
    answer:
      "Advantage+ audience uses Meta’s automation to find people likely to achieve the campaign goal while allowing important controls such as location, minimum age, language and exclusions. Audience suggestions can guide the system without always restricting delivery to a narrow targeting definition.",
  },
  {
    question: "What are Advantage+ placements?",
    answer:
      "Advantage+ placements allow Meta to distribute ads across eligible placements where the system expects efficient results. Manual placement restrictions may still be used when creative, compliance or business requirements justify them.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you set up Meta Pixel and Conversions API?",
    answer:
      "Yes. We can review or implement Pixel events and plan Conversions API integration using a website platform, partner integration, server setup or CRM connection where technically and legally appropriate.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can Meta Ads generate qualified leads?",
    answer:
      "Meta can generate leads through website forms, instant forms, messages and calls. Lead quality depends on the offer, audience, creative, questions, destination and follow-up process. We use qualification and CRM feedback where possible instead of optimising only for the lowest cost per form.",
  },
  {
    question: "How quickly do Meta Ads show results?",
    answer:
      "Campaigns can begin delivering soon after approval, but reliable performance requires enough reach, creative variation and conversion data. Early results depend on the objective, audience size, budget, offer, tracking and creative quality.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you guarantee a fixed number of leads or sales?",
    answer:
      "No responsible advertiser can guarantee fixed results because performance depends on market demand, creative, budget, competition, website or form experience, tracking and sales follow-up. We provide transparent management, testing and reporting around agreed business goals.",
