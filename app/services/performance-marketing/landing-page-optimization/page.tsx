const FAQS = [
  {
    question: "What is included in Landing Page Optimization?",
    answer:
      "The service can include message-match review, copy and hierarchy improvements, UX and mobile analysis, form optimisation, trust and proof, page-speed recommendations, conversion tracking, testing strategy and qualified-conversion reporting.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is Landing Page Optimization the same as website redesign?",
    answer:
      "No. Landing Page Optimization focuses on improving a specific campaign or conversion experience. It may involve significant changes, but the work is driven by conversion evidence and user intent rather than a complete visual redesign of the website.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you create new landing pages?",
    answer:
      "Yes. We can optimise an existing page or create a new campaign-specific landing page when the current website cannot provide sufficient message match, focus, tracking or conversion control.",
  },
  {
    question: "What should a landing page include?",
    answer:
      "The exact content depends on the offer, but most effective pages need a clear headline, value proposition, relevant proof, useful details, objection handling, a strong primary action and a mobile-friendly conversion path.",
  },
  {
    question: "How many form fields should a landing page use?",
    answer:
      "There is no universal number. The form should collect the minimum information required to complete, route or qualify the enquiry. Removing fields can improve completion, but it can also reduce lead quality if important qualification information is lost.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you run A/B tests?",
    answer:
      "Yes, when the page has enough traffic, conversions, stable tracking and an appropriate testing tool. Where volume is limited, we use evidence-led sequential improvements and monitor results carefully instead of claiming statistical certainty.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do you measure landing-page success?",
    answer:
      "Measurement can include conversion rate, form completion, calls, bookings, purchases, qualified leads, revenue, cost per qualified conversion and experiment results. The primary metric is agreed according to the campaign goal.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can a faster page improve paid campaign performance?",
    answer:
      "Speed can reduce abandonment and improve user experience, especially on mobile. Its business impact depends on the current performance problem, page complexity, connection quality and the rest of the conversion experience.",
  },
  {
    question: "How quickly can landing-page improvements show results?",
    answer:
      "Changes can affect behaviour as soon as they are released, but reliable conclusions require enough traffic and conversions. Timing depends on campaign volume, conversion rate, test design, implementation quality and downstream lead or sales feedback.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you guarantee a specific conversion-rate increase?",
    answer:
      "No responsible optimisation service can guarantee a fixed uplift because results depend on traffic quality, offer, pricing, brand trust, page experience, tracking and market conditions. We use evidence, testing and transparent reporting to improve the probability of better outcomes.",
