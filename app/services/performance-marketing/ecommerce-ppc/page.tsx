const FAQS = [
  {
    question: "What is included in your Ecommerce PPC service?",
    answer:
      "The service can include paid acquisition strategy, product and category prioritisation, campaign structure, feed readiness, creative testing, bidding, budgets, remarketing, purchase tracking, revenue analysis and ongoing optimisation. The exact channel mix depends on your store, products and goals.",
  },
  {
    question: "Which advertising channels are used for Ecommerce PPC?",
    answer:
      "Ecommerce PPC can include Google Search, Google Shopping, eligible automated Google campaign types, Meta Ads, YouTube and remarketing. Channel selection depends on product demand, visual appeal, search behaviour, margins, budget and tracking readiness.",
  },
  {
    question: "How is Ecommerce PPC different from Google Shopping Ads?",
    answer:
      "Google Shopping Ads are one specific product-ad channel. Ecommerce PPC is broader and coordinates search, shopping, social, video, remarketing, product economics, creative, measurement and customer acquisition across the complete paid ecommerce programme.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you optimise product feeds?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Feed work can include titles, descriptions, categories, product types, identifiers, pricing, availability and image quality, along with issue and disapproval monitoring. The depth of feed management depends on the platform and catalogue setup.",
  },
  {
    question: "What ROAS should an ecommerce store target?",
    answer:
      "The correct ROAS depends on gross margin, discounts, shipping, payment costs, returns, repeat purchase and operating goals. A high revenue-based ROAS can still be unprofitable, so targets should reflect actual business economics.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can Ecommerce PPC help acquire new customers?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Prospecting campaigns can be separated from remarketing and returning-customer activity. Where platform and ecommerce data allow, new-customer performance can be reviewed separately so acquisition quality is clearer.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you manage remarketing for ecommerce stores?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Remarketing can include product viewers, category visitors, cart users, checkout users and past customers, with exclusions and frequency controls based on the buying cycle and product type.",
  },
  {
    question: "How quickly can Ecommerce PPC generate sales?",
    answer:
      "Campaigns can generate traffic and orders after launch, but reliable profitability patterns require enough product-level demand and conversion data. Results depend on price, product-market fit, competition, creative, website experience, stock and tracking quality.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you include creative production?",
    answer:
      "The service can include creative strategy, product images, static ads, video briefs, UGC concepts and placement adaptations. Production scope is agreed according to channel mix, catalogue size and testing requirements.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you guarantee a specific ROAS or revenue?",
    answer:
      "No responsible PPC provider can guarantee a fixed ROAS or revenue because performance depends on demand, competition, pricing, margin, stock, website conversion, creative, budget and measurement. We provide transparent management and optimisation around agreed commercial goals.",
  },
