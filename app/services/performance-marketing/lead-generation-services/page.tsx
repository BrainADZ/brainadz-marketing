const FAQS = [
  {
    question: "What is included in your Lead Generation service?",
    answer:
      "The service can include channel strategy, audience and keyword research, offer planning, paid campaign setup, landing pages or native forms, call and message tracking, CRM routing, lead qualification, sales feedback, optimisation and reporting.",
  },
  {
    question: "Which platforms do you use for lead generation?",
    answer:
      "Depending on the business, lead generation can use Google Ads, Meta Ads, LinkedIn Ads, YouTube, remarketing and other relevant paid channels. Channel selection is based on demand, audience, sales value, budget and conversion journey.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is a qualified lead?",
    answer:
      "A qualified lead is a genuine prospect that matches agreed business criteria such as service requirement, geography, company type, budget, timing or decision role. The definition is agreed with the sales team before campaigns are evaluated.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you use website forms or native lead forms?",
    answer:
      "Both can be used. Website forms are useful when the page needs to explain the offer and build trust, while native platform forms can reduce friction. The choice depends on intent, required qualification information and lead-quality performance.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can you track phone-call leads?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Call clicks, call extensions, tracked phone numbers or call-platform integrations can be used depending on the website, platform and technical setup. Call quality still requires business or CRM feedback.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you connect campaigns with a CRM?",
    answer:
      "Yes, where the CRM and technical access support it. We can plan lead-source fields, UTM parameters, routing, notifications, status definitions and offline conversion feedback so campaign decisions use downstream outcomes.",
  },
  {
    question: "How quickly should sales teams contact a new lead?",
    answer:
      "Faster response is generally preferable, but the correct service-level target depends on the industry, operating hours, urgency and lead source. We define a practical response workflow and monitor whether it is followed.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do you reduce spam and poor-quality leads?",
    answer:
      "We use targeting, negative keywords, exclusions, form validation, qualification questions, confirmation steps, CRM feedback and sales rejection reasons. No system removes every low-quality submission, but the feedback loop helps reduce them.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do you report lead generation performance?",
    answer:
      "Reporting can include total leads, valid leads, qualified leads, cost per lead, cost per qualified lead, response time, appointment rate, opportunities, pipeline and customers depending on available CRM and sales data.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you guarantee a fixed number of leads?",
    answer:
      "No responsible lead generation service can guarantee a fixed number and quality of leads because results depend on market demand, budget, competition, offer, conversion experience, tracking and sales follow-up. We provide transparent optimisation around agreed quality and commercial goals.",
