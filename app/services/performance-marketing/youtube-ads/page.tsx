const FAQS = [
  {
    question: "What is included in your YouTube Ads service?",
    answer:
      "The service can include campaign strategy, audience research, ad-format planning, creative briefs, video ad setup, bidding, conversion tracking, optimisation and reporting. The exact scope depends on whether the goal is awareness, views, engagement, website action, leads or sales.",
  },
  {
    question: "Which YouTube ad formats do you manage?",
    answer:
      "We can manage skippable in-stream, non-skippable in-stream, in-feed video, bumper and YouTube Shorts ads, subject to campaign type, objective, account eligibility and available creative assets.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the difference between in-stream and in-feed ads?",
    answer:
      "In-stream ads play around video content, while in-feed ads appear in YouTube discovery environments such as Search, Home and related browsing surfaces. In-feed ads rely strongly on the thumbnail and headline because the viewer chooses to open the video.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do YouTube Shorts ads need vertical videos?",
    answer:
      "Vertical 9:16 video is strongly recommended for Shorts because it matches the mobile-first full-screen experience. Horizontal and square assets may be supported in some campaign setups, but vertical creative is generally better suited to the format.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you create YouTube ad videos?",
    answer:
      "The service can include creative strategy, scripts, storyboards, production briefs, editing and format adaptations. The production scope depends on the number of concepts, shoot requirements, animation and monthly testing needs.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can YouTube Ads generate leads and sales?",
    answer:
      "Yes. YouTube campaigns and eligible Google campaign types can optimise toward website conversions when conversion tracking is configured correctly. Performance depends on the offer, audience, creative, landing page, budget and quality of the conversion signal.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long should a YouTube ad be?",
    answer:
      "The right duration depends on format and objective. Bumper ads are six seconds, Shorts creative is usually brief and vertical, while skippable in-stream and in-feed videos can support longer explanations. The message should earn attention quickly regardless of total length.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do you measure YouTube Ads performance?",
    answer:
      "Measurement can include reach, frequency, TrueView views, view rate, watch time, completion, clicks, website conversions, qualified leads, purchases, conversion value and format-level performance.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can YouTube Ads target specific channels or topics?",
    answer:
      "Some reach and consideration campaign types can use content signals such as topics, keywords or placements. Availability and suitability depend on the campaign objective and subtype, and conversion-focused campaign setups may rely more heavily on audience and automated delivery.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you guarantee a fixed number of views, leads or sales?",
    answer:
      "No responsible video advertising service can guarantee fixed business results. Performance depends on the objective, audience, creative, budget, competition, measurement, website experience and sales process. We provide transparent planning, optimisation and reporting.",
