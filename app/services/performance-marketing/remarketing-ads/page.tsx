  {
    question: "What is included in your Remarketing Ads service?",
    answer:
      "The service can include audience strategy, website and engagement audiences, membership windows, customer-list segments, exclusions, dynamic ads, creative sequencing, frequency management, conversion tracking, optimisation and reporting across relevant advertising platforms.",
  },
  {
    question: "Which platforms can be used for remarketing?",
    answer:
      "Remarketing can be used across eligible Google Ads, YouTube, Facebook and Instagram campaign types. The exact features and audience requirements depend on the platform, campaign type, data source and account eligibility.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the difference between remarketing and retargeting?",
    answer:
      "The terms are commonly used interchangeably. In practice, both refer to re-engaging people who previously interacted with a website, app, content, social account, video, customer list or business.",
  },
  {
    question: "What are audience membership windows?",
    answer:
      "A membership window controls how long an eligible user remains in an audience after the qualifying interaction. Short windows can suit cart or form abandonment, while longer windows may support complex B2B or high-consideration purchases.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is dynamic remarketing?",
    answer:
      "Dynamic remarketing uses a product or business-data feed together with website or app events to show ads containing items related to what a user previously viewed or considered. Accurate identifiers, event matching and feed data are essential.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can you remarket using a customer list?",
    answer:
      "Eligible platforms can use customer data that the business collected directly, such as email addresses or phone numbers, subject to platform policies, consent requirements and account eligibility. The business must have the appropriate rights to use and upload that data.",
  },
  {
    question: "Should recent purchasers see remarketing ads?",
    answer:
      "Recent purchasers are usually excluded from acquisition or cart-recovery messages. They may enter a separate post-purchase journey for onboarding, replenishment, renewal, loyalty or relevant cross-sell offers.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do you prevent remarketing ads from becoming annoying?",
    answer:
      "We use audience windows, exclusions, creative sequencing, budget controls and frequency monitoring. Creative is refreshed or delivery is reduced when repetition no longer generates useful response.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do you measure remarketing performance?",
    answer:
      "Reporting can include audience health, reach, frequency, conversions, cart or form recovery, qualified leads, revenue, assisted outcomes and incremental comparison where suitable testing is possible.",
  },
  {
    question: "Does remarketing guarantee more conversions?",
    answer:
      "No. Remarketing can improve re-engagement, but results depend on audience quality, offer, timing, creative, website experience, tracking and the strength of the original demand. We provide transparent optimisation rather than guaranteed outcomes.",
