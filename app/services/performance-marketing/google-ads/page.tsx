const FAQS = [
  {
    question: "What is included in your Google Ads service?",
    answer:
      "The service can include account strategy, keyword research, campaign and ad-group structure, responsive search ads, negative keywords, bidding, budgets, conversion tracking, landing-page recommendations, ongoing optimisation and reporting. The exact scope depends on your business goals and existing account condition.",
  },
  {
    question: "Does this service include Google Shopping, YouTube and Display campaigns?",
    answer:
      "This page focuses primarily on Google Search Ads. BrainADZ provides dedicated services for Google Shopping Ads, YouTube Ads and Display Ads so each channel can use the correct strategy, creative, targeting and measurement framework.",
  },
  {
    question: "How much budget should we spend on Google Ads?",
    answer:
      "Budget depends on search demand, competition, geography, conversion rate, customer value and the amount of data required to make reliable decisions. We recommend a starting budget after reviewing keyword costs, goals and business economics rather than using one fixed amount for every advertiser.",
  },
  {
    question: "How quickly can Google Ads generate leads?",
    answer:
      "Campaigns can begin generating traffic soon after approval and launch, but reliable lead and cost patterns require enough conversion data and search-term evidence. Early results also depend on tracking quality, offer strength, landing pages, competition and budget.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you create the ad copy?",
    answer:
      "Yes. We create responsive search ad headlines and descriptions aligned with keyword intent, offer, proof and the landing page. Messaging is reviewed and improved as performance data becomes available.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you set up conversion tracking?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Tracking can include forms, calls, purchases and other meaningful actions using Google Ads, Google tag, Google Tag Manager or analytics integrations. Enhanced conversions and offline outcome feedback can also be planned where the required data and consent processes are available.",
  },
  {
    question: "What are negative keywords?",
    answer:
      "Negative keywords help prevent ads from showing for searches that are irrelevant or commercially unsuitable. They are developed before launch and expanded through ongoing search-term reviews.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can you improve an existing Google Ads account?",
    answer:
      "Yes. We can audit existing campaign structure, search terms, ads, keywords, bidding, budgets, tracking and landing-page alignment, then rebuild or optimise the account according to the findings.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do you measure lead quality?",
    answer:
      "Where possible, we connect campaign data with CRM or sales outcomes such as valid lead, qualified lead, opportunity, booking, sale or revenue. This helps distinguish campaigns that generate cheap forms from campaigns that generate useful business results.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you guarantee a specific number of leads or sales?",
    answer:
      "No responsible Google Ads service can guarantee a fixed result because performance depends on demand, competition, budget, offer, website experience, tracking and sales follow-up. We provide transparent activity, measurement and optimisation around agreed business goals.",
