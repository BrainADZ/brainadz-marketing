const FAQS = [
  {
    question: "What is included in your SEM service?",
    answer:
      "The service can include account audit, keyword research, campaign strategy, ad creation, targeting, budget management, conversion tracking, landing-page recommendations, ongoing optimization and performance reporting. The final scope depends on your advertising goals and platforms.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the difference between SEM, SEO and PPC?",
    answer:
      "SEM is the broader process of increasing visibility through paid search engine campaigns. PPC refers to the advertising payment model where advertisers commonly pay for clicks. SEO focuses on improving unpaid organic search visibility over time.",
  },
  {
    question: "Which advertising platforms do you manage?",
    answer:
      "We primarily support Google Ads and can also manage Microsoft Advertising where it is relevant to the audience and market. Campaign recommendations depend on search demand, competition, geography and available budget.",
  },
  {
    question: "How much budget is required for SEM?",
    answer:
      "The required budget depends on keyword competition, location, industry, campaign objective and expected lead volume. We recommend a practical starting budget after reviewing search demand and estimated cost-per-click levels.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is advertising spend included in your management fee?",
    answer:
      "No. The amount paid directly to the advertising platform is separate from campaign strategy and management fees. Both amounts are clearly defined before the campaign begins.",
  },
  {
    question: "How quickly can SEM generate results?",
    answer:
      "Campaigns can begin generating traffic and enquiries soon after launch, but stable performance usually requires sufficient data and ongoing optimization. Results depend on search demand, competition, budget, offer quality, landing pages and tracking accuracy.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you create landing pages for SEM campaigns?",
    answer:
      "We review existing landing pages and provide conversion-focused recommendations. Dedicated landing-page design and development can also be included when the current website does not provide a suitable campaign destination.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do you reduce wasted advertising spend?",
    answer:
      "We regularly review search terms, negative keywords, locations, devices, schedules, audience signals and conversion data. Irrelevant traffic is excluded while budgets and bids are adjusted towards stronger-performing opportunities.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do you measure SEM performance?",
    answer:
      "Performance is measured using metrics connected to the campaign objective, including impressions, click-through rate, cost per click, conversion rate, cost per lead, calls, enquiries, purchases and return on advertising spend where revenue tracking is available.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can you manage an existing Google Ads account?",
    answer:
      "Yes. We can audit and optimize an existing account or rebuild its campaign structure when necessary. Existing data is reviewed before major changes are made so useful historical insights are not lost.",
