const FAQS = [
  {
    question: "What is included in your ORM service?",
    answer:
      "The service can include reputation auditing, brand mention monitoring, review management, response strategy, sentiment analysis, escalation planning, search reputation recommendations and monthly reporting. The final scope depends on your brand size, active platforms and risk level.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is online reputation management?",
    answer:
      "Online reputation management is the process of monitoring, understanding and improving how a brand, business or individual is represented across search engines, review platforms, social media, news websites and other public digital channels.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can you remove negative reviews?",
    answer:
      "Legitimate negative reviews generally cannot and should not be removed simply because they are critical. Reviews may be reported when they clearly violate a platform's policies, but removal decisions remain with the platform. Our focus is on professional responses, resolution and long-term reputation improvement.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you respond to customer reviews on our behalf?",
    answer:
      "Yes. We can prepare or manage responses according to an approved tone, process and escalation framework. Sensitive or operational complaints may require information and approval from your internal team before a public response is posted.",
  },
  {
    question: "Which platforms do you monitor?",
    answer:
      "Monitoring can cover Google search results, Google Business Profile, social media channels, review websites, news sources, forums and relevant industry communities. The exact channel mix depends on where your audiences discuss or evaluate your brand.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do you handle a reputation crisis?",
    answer:
      "We first verify the issue, assess its visibility and impact, classify the risk and identify the required stakeholders. A coordinated response is then developed with clear messaging, approval, channel selection and follow-up actions.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long does ORM take to show results?",
    answer:
      "Response quality and monitoring can improve immediately after implementation. Ratings, branded search perception and long-term trust usually require consistent customer experience, useful content and reputation management over several months.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can ORM improve Google ratings?",
    answer:
      "ORM can improve how reviews are monitored, answered and requested from genuine customers. However, ratings depend primarily on real customer experiences and authentic feedback. We do not support fake reviews or manipulative rating practices.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you manage personal reputation for founders or executives?",
    answer:
      "Yes. The service can include branded search monitoring, leadership profile review, media mention tracking, thought-leadership recommendations and response planning for founders, executives or public-facing professionals.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do you measure ORM performance?",
    answer:
      "Performance can be measured through rating trends, review volume, sentiment patterns, response time, issue resolution, branded search visibility, recurring complaint categories and changes in positive or negative conversation share.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can you work with our customer service or legal team?",
    answer:
      "Yes. ORM often requires coordination with customer service, operations, HR, legal, public relations and leadership. We define ownership, approvals and escalation rules so public responses remain accurate and controlled.",
