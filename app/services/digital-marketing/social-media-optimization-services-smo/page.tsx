const FAQS = [
  {
    question: "What is included in your SMO service?",
    answer:
      "Our SMO service can include profile audits, bio and description optimization, keyword research, hashtag planning, content structure recommendations, visual consistency review, link optimization, action-button setup and performance recommendations. The final scope is aligned with your active platforms and business goals.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the difference between SMM and SMO?",
    answer:
      "Social Media Marketing focuses on planning, creating, publishing and promoting social content. Social Media Optimization focuses on improving profiles, content signals, discoverability, engagement pathways and conversion readiness. Both services can work together, but they solve different parts of social media growth.",
  },
  {
    question: "Which social platforms can you optimize?",
    answer:
      "We can optimize business profiles on Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn, YouTube, X and other relevant platforms. The recommended platforms depend on your audience, industry, content capability and business objective.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can you optimize our existing social media accounts?",
    answer:
      "Yes. We can review and improve existing accounts without requiring you to start again. We retain useful profile elements and content while correcting inconsistencies, missing information and weak discoverability or conversion signals.",
  },
  {
    question: "Does SMO help increase followers?",
    answer:
      "SMO can improve profile quality, discoverability, relevance and audience experience, which can support organic follower growth. However, follower growth also depends on content quality, posting consistency, audience demand, competition and promotional activity.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you provide keyword and hashtag research?",
    answer:
      "Yes. We identify relevant service keywords, audience terms, content topics and hashtag groups. These are organized by platform and content intent instead of using the same generic hashtags on every post.",
  },
  {
    question: "Will you also create and publish social media content?",
    answer:
      "Content creation and publishing are generally covered under our SMM service. They can be added to an SMO engagement when required so profile optimization and ongoing content execution follow the same strategy.",
  },
  {
    question: "How quickly can SMO show results?",
    answer:
      "Profile clarity and consistency can improve as soon as the recommended changes are implemented. Discoverability, engagement and conversion improvements usually become clearer over time as optimized profiles receive consistent, relevant content and audience activity.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is SMO a one-time or ongoing service?",
    answer:
      "A complete foundational optimization can be delivered as a one-time project. Ongoing review is recommended because platform features, audience behavior, content trends and business priorities continue to change.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do you measure SMO performance?",
    answer:
      "We review relevant indicators such as profile visits, search visibility, reach, engagement quality, website clicks, contact actions, enquiries and content discovery patterns. The selected metrics depend on the role of each social platform.",
