const FAQS = [
  {
    question: "What is included in your WhatsApp marketing service?",
    answer:
      "The service can include strategy, opt-in planning, audience segmentation, campaign messaging, approved message templates, broadcast management, automation, chatbot flows, CRM integration and performance reporting. The final scope depends on your customer journey and technology setup.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the difference between WhatsApp Marketing and bulk messaging?",
    answer:
      "WhatsApp marketing uses permission-based audiences, relevant segmentation, approved communication practices and measurable customer journeys. Uncontrolled bulk messaging sends the same message to large contact lists and can create poor customer experience, complaints and account risks.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can we send promotional messages to any phone number?",
    answer:
      "Marketing messages should only be sent to customers who have provided suitable permission to receive communication from the business. Purchased, scraped or unrelated contact lists should not be used.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you help set up the WhatsApp Business Platform?",
    answer:
      "Yes. We can support planning and coordination for business setup, messaging use cases, templates, automation, team access and integrations. Exact setup requirements depend on the selected technology provider and current business systems.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can you create WhatsApp chatbots?",
    answer:
      "Yes. We can design structured chatbot flows for frequently asked questions, product selection, enquiry qualification, appointment requests, order information and human agent handover.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can WhatsApp be connected with our CRM?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Depending on the CRM and WhatsApp solution, customer messages, lead data, journey stages and follow-up activity can be synchronized or passed between systems.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can you send automated order and appointment updates?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Transactional journeys can include order confirmations, delivery updates, payment reminders, booking confirmations, appointment reminders and service notifications when the required data and integrations are available.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can WhatsApp Marketing help recover abandoned carts?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Ecommerce businesses can use permission-based reminder journeys to reconnect with customers who leave items in their carts. Results depend on audience consent, timing, product relevance, pricing and checkout experience.",
  },
  {
    question: "How often should WhatsApp campaigns be sent?",
    answer:
      "Frequency depends on customer expectations, campaign relevance, purchase cycle and message value. WhatsApp is a personal communication channel, so excessive or repetitive messaging should be avoided.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do you measure WhatsApp Marketing performance?",
    answer:
      "Performance can be measured using delivery, read and response activity, link clicks, enquiries, qualified leads, completed purchases, support outcomes and customer opt-out behaviour where the selected platform provides these data points.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you manage customer replies after a campaign?",
    answer:
      "Reply management can be included through chatbot automation, shared team inbox workflows or human agent routing. Responsibilities and response timelines are defined before campaigns are launched.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can WhatsApp campaigns be integrated with click-to-message ads?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Relevant advertising campaigns can direct users into a WhatsApp conversation where automated qualification, product information or human sales support continues the journey.",
