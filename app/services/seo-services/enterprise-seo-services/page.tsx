const FAQS = [
  {
    question: "What is included in your Enterprise SEO service?",
    answer:
      "Enterprise SEO can include large-scale technical audits, crawl and index management, template optimisation, information architecture, content governance, internal linking, migrations, automation, cross-functional workflows and executive reporting. The final scope depends on the organisation, platform, page inventory and business priorities.",
  },
  {
    question: "How is Enterprise SEO different from regular SEO?",
    answer:
      "Enterprise SEO manages greater scale, complexity and organisational dependency. Changes often affect large page groups and require coordination across engineering, product, content, analytics, legal, regional and executive teams. Governance and implementation systems are therefore as important as recommendations.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you work with in-house SEO teams?",
    answer:
      "Yes. BrainADZ can support an existing in-house team with strategy, specialist audits, roadmap prioritisation, technical requirements, content governance, migrations, executive reporting or implementation validation.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can you support websites with millions of URLs?",
    answer:
      "Yes, provided the scope and data access are appropriate. Large websites require page-group analysis, sampling, templates, log or crawl data, Search Console segmentation and scalable monitoring rather than manual review of every URL.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you provide developer-ready SEO requirements?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Technical recommendations can be translated into implementation requirements, examples, affected templates, acceptance criteria, QA steps and release validation guidance.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can you support enterprise website migrations?",
    answer:
      "Yes. We can support domain changes, replatforming, redesigns, acquisitions, URL restructures and major routing changes through inventory creation, benchmarks, redirect mapping, staging review, launch monitoring and post-release validation.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do you prioritise Enterprise SEO work?",
    answer:
      "Work is prioritised using commercial importance, affected scale, search opportunity, technical risk, effort, dependencies and implementation readiness. This helps teams focus on changes with the strongest realistic enterprise impact.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do you measure Enterprise SEO performance?",
    answer:
      "Measurement can include portfolio visibility, crawl and index health, page-group traffic, conversions, revenue, implementation progress and competitive movement. Reporting is segmented by the organisation's actual brands, markets, products and strategic initiatives.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long does Enterprise SEO take to show results?",
    answer:
      "Some technical or template fixes can create early movement after implementation, while large content, architecture and authority initiatives require sustained work. Enterprise timelines are strongly influenced by release cycles, dependencies, platform constraints and organisational decision speed.",
  },
