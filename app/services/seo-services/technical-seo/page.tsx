const FAQS = [
  {
    question: "What is included in your Technical SEO service?",

      "A Technical SEO engagement can include crawling and indexation audits, canonical and redirect analysis, JavaScript rendering checks, Core Web Vitals diagnostics, structured-data validation, XML sitemap and robots review, log-file analysis, implementation tickets, quality assurance and ongoing technical reporting. The final scope depends on the website, platform, scale and development access.",
  },
  {
    question: "How is Technical SEO different from on-page SEO?",
    answer:
      "Technical SEO focuses on whether search engines can discover, render, understand and index the website efficiently. On-page SEO focuses more directly on page targeting, headings, copy, internal relevance and search intent. Both work together, but technical problems can prevent strong on-page work from being processed correctly.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can Technical SEO improve rankings by itself?",
    answer:
      "Technical fixes can create meaningful gains when crawling, indexing, rendering or performance problems are limiting otherwise useful pages. However, competitive rankings also depend on content relevance, authority, user value and market conditions. We report technical impact without treating technical SEO as an isolated guarantee.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you work with JavaScript websites and Next.js?",
    answer:
      "Yes. We review server-rendered, statically generated and client-rendered implementations, including Next.js applications. The analysis covers routing, metadata, rendered HTML, internal links, canonicals, hydration, lazy loading, structured data and the availability of important content to search engines.",
  },
  {
    question: "What are Core Web Vitals?",
    answer:
      "Core Web Vitals are user-experience metrics focused on loading performance, interaction responsiveness and visual stability. The primary metrics are Largest Contentful Paint, Interaction to Next Paint and Cumulative Layout Shift. We use field and laboratory data to locate template-level causes and prioritise practical fixes.",
  },
  {
    question: "Why are pages crawled but not indexed?",
    answer:
      "A crawled page may remain unindexed because it appears duplicate, low value, thin, conflicting, poorly linked or inconsistent with canonical and robots signals. Indexing is also influenced by overall site quality and search demand. We examine the affected URL groups rather than assuming one universal cause.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you provide implementation support for developers?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Recommendations can be converted into development tickets with affected templates, technical requirements, examples, acceptance criteria and validation steps. We can review proposed fixes, test staging environments and confirm whether released changes produce the intended technical signals.",
  },
  {
    question: "When is log-file analysis useful?",
    answer:
      "Log analysis is especially useful for large, frequently updated or technically complex websites. It shows which URLs verified search-engine bots request, how often they crawl, which status codes they encounter and whether crawl activity is concentrated on valuable or low-value areas.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do you report Technical SEO performance?",
    answer:
      "Reporting can cover crawl errors, index coverage, submitted and indexed URLs, duplicate patterns, Core Web Vitals, rendering checks, structured-data health, implementation status and organic landing-page trends. Reports distinguish diagnosed issues, completed fixes and observed outcomes.",
