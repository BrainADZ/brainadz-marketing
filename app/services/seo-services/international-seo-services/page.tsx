const FAQS = [
  {
    question: "What is included in your International SEO service?",
    answer:
      "International SEO can include country and language research, international site architecture, hreflang, canonical and sitemap governance, market-specific keyword mapping, content localisation, regional authority building, launch validation and country-level reporting. The final scope depends on your markets, platform and operating model.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the difference between International SEO and Local SEO?",
    answer:
      "International SEO manages visibility across countries and languages, including architecture, hreflang, localisation and regional authority. Local SEO focuses on location-based searches, Google Business Profile, map visibility, citations, reviews and local landing pages within a defined service area or branch network.",
  },
  {
    question: "Should we use country domains, subdomains or subdirectories?",
    answer:
      "The right structure depends on existing authority, market operations, platform capability, legal requirements, brand strategy and maintenance capacity. Subdirectories often consolidate authority efficiently, while country-code domains provide stronger separation but require more independent investment.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is hreflang used for?",
    answer:
      "Hreflang helps search engines understand equivalent language or country versions of a page and select the most appropriate version for a user. It does not replace canonicals, redirects, localisation or a clear international architecture.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can translated content rank internationally?",
    answer:
      "Translated content can rank when it is accurate, useful and aligned with local search intent. Direct translation alone is often insufficient because keywords, terminology, examples, proof, offers and conversion expectations vary by market.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do we need separate pages for countries using the same language?",
    answer:
      "Only when the markets have meaningful differences in search demand, products, services, pricing, regulations, proof or conversion journeys. Near-identical country pages created only by changing the country name can create duplication and weak user value.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can you support international ecommerce SEO?",
    answer:
      "Yes. International ecommerce work can include regional categories and products, currencies, availability, shipping, variants, product data, hreflang, canonical rules, faceted navigation and market-level revenue reporting.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long does International SEO take to show results?",
    answer:
      "Technical corrections can improve market selection after recrawling, while new-country visibility and authority usually require sustained work. Timing depends on competition, domain authority, localisation quality, platform limitations, market demand and implementation speed.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do you measure International SEO performance?",
    answer:
      "We report visibility, clicks, landing-page performance, technical health, conversions and revenue by country, language and market page group. This prevents strong results in one region from hiding weak performance in another.",
  },
