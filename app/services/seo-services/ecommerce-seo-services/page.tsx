The final scope depends on your platform, catalogue size, implementation access and commercial priorities.",
  },
  {
    question: "How is Ecommerce SEO different from regular SEO?",
    answer:
      "Ecommerce SEO must manage large numbers of category, product, variant, filter and parameter URLs while connecting visibility directly to transactions and revenue. It also requires closer coordination with merchandising, inventory, product data, structured data and platform templates than a typical content-led website.",
  },
  {
    question: "Should every product filter be indexed?",
    answer:
      "No. Most filter combinations should remain available for users without becoming indexable search landing pages. We evaluate demand, uniqueness, inventory depth and business value to decide which filtered pages deserve dedicated URLs and which should be controlled through canonicals, noindex rules, robots directives or internal-link restrictions.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do you optimise ecommerce category pages?",
    answer:
      "We align each category with a distinct commercial search theme, improve titles and headings, add useful supporting copy, strengthen internal links, review pagination and canonicals, improve product discovery and ensure the page offers enough inventory and decision-making value to satisfy the search intent.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do product descriptions need to be unique?",
    answer:
      "Unique product content is valuable when it adds information shoppers need, such as benefits, specifications, compatibility, sizing, use cases, comparisons, delivery details or FAQs. Rewriting manufacturer text without adding useful value is less important than improving the completeness and usefulness of the page.",
  },
  {
    question: "What should happen to out-of-stock or discontinued product pages?",
    answer:
      "The correct treatment depends on whether the product will return, whether the URL has search demand or backlinks and whether a relevant replacement exists. Temporarily unavailable products can often remain live, while discontinued products may be retained, redirected or removed according to their continuing value.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can you work with Shopify, WooCommerce or custom ecommerce platforms?",
    answer:
      "Yes. The strategy is platform-independent, but implementation methods vary. We adapt recommendations to the platform's routing, template, app, plugin, structured-data, rendering and deployment constraints, and we identify where developer support is required.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long does Ecommerce SEO take to show results?",
    answer:
      "Critical crawl, indexation and template fixes may create early improvements, while category growth, product discovery and revenue gains usually require sustained implementation. Timing depends on catalogue size, competition, platform limitations, development speed, content quality and the site's existing authority.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do you measure Ecommerce SEO performance?",
    answer:
      "We combine category and product visibility with organic clicks, product views, add-to-cart activity, transactions, conversion rate and revenue. Reporting also monitors index coverage, crawl quality, structured-data health and the landing-page groups creating or losing commercial value.",
