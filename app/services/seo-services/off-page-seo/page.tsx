const FAQS = [
  {
    question: "What is included in your Off Page SEO service?",
    answer:
      "An Off Page SEO engagement can include backlink analysis, editorial link acquisition, digital PR, brand-mention monitoring, citation management, review and reputation support, partnership opportunities, link reclamation, risk review and transparent reporting. The exact mix depends on your business model, current authority and target markets.",
  },
  {
    question: "How is Off Page SEO different from Link Building?",
    answer:
      "Link building focuses specifically on earning and managing backlinks. Off Page SEO is broader and can include links, unlinked brand mentions, digital PR, reviews, citations, business profiles, partnerships, reputation signals and referral visibility. Link building is therefore one part of a complete Off Page SEO strategy.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you guarantee a fixed number of backlinks?",
    answer:
      "No. Genuine editorial links depend on relevance, publisher decisions, campaign quality and available assets. We define activity, quality standards and reporting clearly, but we do not promise artificial quantities or guaranteed placements.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do brand mentions help even without a backlink?",
    answer:
      "Unlinked mentions can still improve brand discovery, credibility and referral awareness. They can also create future reclamation opportunities. Their exact search impact is difficult to isolate, so we evaluate them as part of the broader authority and reputation picture.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you manage online reviews?",
    answer:
      "We can support review-request workflows, response frameworks, monitoring and recurring-theme analysis. We do not create fake reviews, offer incentives for positive ratings or use review gating.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you submit businesses to directories?",
    answer:
      "Only where the directory or profile is relevant, credible and useful for the business. We prioritise important general, industry, local and market-specific sources rather than mass submissions to low-quality directories.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can you remove harmful or spammy backlinks?",
    answer:
      "We can audit suspicious links, identify patterns, review manual-action risks and recommend outreach, reclamation or disavowal steps where justified. Most low-quality links do not require immediate action, so decisions are made carefully rather than disavowing large groups automatically.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long does Off Page SEO take to show results?",
    answer:
      "Prospecting and cleanup can begin early, while earned coverage, authority growth and search impact usually develop over several months. Timing depends on competition, brand credibility, content assets, publisher response cycles and the strength of the website being promoted.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do you report Off Page SEO performance?",
    answer:
      "Reporting can include qualified outreach, earned and lost links, brand mentions, citations, review trends, referral traffic, search visibility and assisted conversions. We separate completed activity from earned outcomes so the programme remains transparent.",

                Link building is an important part of the work, but it is not the
                entire strategy. Strong off-site visibility also depends on where
                the brand is discussed, how consistently it is represented and
                whether third-party sources reinforce credibility.
