const FAQS = [
  {
    question: "What is included in your On Page SEO service?",
    answer:
      "An On Page SEO engagement can include keyword-to-page mapping, search-intent analysis, title and meta-description optimisation, heading structure, content improvement, internal linking, image optimisation, structured data, conversion alignment and page-level reporting. The exact scope depends on your website, content quality and commercial priorities.",
  },
  {
    question: "How is On Page SEO different from Technical SEO?",
    answer:
      "On Page SEO focuses on the relevance, usefulness, structure and conversion quality of individual pages. Technical SEO focuses more on crawling, rendering, indexing, performance, canonicals, structured-data infrastructure and site-wide technical controls. Both areas often need to work together.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you rewrite complete website pages?",
    answer:
      "We can provide detailed optimisation briefs, edit existing content or create complete page copy depending on the agreed scope. In many cases, the best result comes from improving strong existing information rather than replacing the entire page.",
  },
  {
    question: "How many keywords should one page target?",
    answer:
      "A page should primarily serve one clear search intent, but that intent can include several closely related keywords, questions and variations. We avoid forcing unrelated topics onto one URL or creating separate pages for every minor keyword variation.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can On Page SEO fix keyword cannibalisation?",
    answer:
      "Yes. We identify pages competing for the same search intent and recommend consolidation, retargeting, internal-link changes, canonical adjustments or content differentiation depending on the cause and value of each URL.",
  },
  {
    question: "Are meta descriptions a ranking factor?",
    answer:
      "Meta descriptions are not generally treated as a direct ranking factor, but they can influence how users understand and click a search result. We optimise them for relevance, differentiation and realistic click value.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you add schema markup during On Page SEO?",
    answer:
      "Where relevant, yes. We review schema types such as Service, Article, Product, FAQ, Breadcrumb and Organisation. Markup must reflect visible page content and follow current eligibility requirements.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long does On Page SEO take to show results?",
    answer:
      "Some pages can improve after they are recrawled and re-evaluated, while competitive topics usually require more time. Results depend on current rankings, content quality, technical condition, authority, competition and how quickly recommendations are implemented.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do you measure On Page SEO performance?",
    answer:
      "We measure rankings, query coverage, impressions, clicks, click-through rate, landing-page engagement, schema visibility and conversion activity. Reporting focuses on the performance of the specific pages and search themes that were optimised.",
  },
