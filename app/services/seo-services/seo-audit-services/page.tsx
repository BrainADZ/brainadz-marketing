const FAQS = [
  {
    question: "What is included in your SEO audit service?",
    answer:
      "An SEO audit can include technical crawling and indexation, site architecture, JavaScript rendering, Core Web Vitals, on-page targeting, content quality, internal linking, backlinks, analytics, conversion tracking and organic landing-page UX. The final scope depends on the website type, scale, platform and business priorities.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is an SEO audit only a technical audit?",
    answer:
      "No. A complete SEO audit should consider technical access, page relevance, content quality, architecture, internal links, external authority, measurement and conversion pathways. A technical-only review can miss major content or commercial problems.",
  },
  {
    question: "What do I receive after the audit?",
    answer:
      "You receive an executive summary, detailed findings with evidence, priority scoring, affected URLs or templates, recommended fixes and an implementation roadmap. Depending on scope, the audit can also include developer tickets, content briefs and a stakeholder handover session.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long does an SEO audit take?",
    answer:
      "Timing depends on website size, technical complexity, data access and the depth of analysis required. A focused audit for a smaller website may be completed faster than a large ecommerce, marketplace, publisher or JavaScript platform with many templates and URL states.",
  },
  {
    question: "Will the audit fix the issues automatically?",
    answer:
      "The audit identifies, validates and prioritises issues. Implementation can be handled by your development and content teams, or BrainADZ can support selected fixes, ticket creation, staging review and post-release validation under a separate implementation scope.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you audit Next.js and JavaScript websites?",
    answer:
      "Yes. We can review server-rendered, statically generated and client-rendered websites, including Next.js. Checks can cover source and rendered HTML, routing, metadata, internal links, canonicals, structured data, hydration, lazy loading and indexability.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can you audit an ecommerce website?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Ecommerce audits can include category and product architecture, faceted navigation, parameters, variants, pagination, product states, structured data, crawl efficiency, internal linking, index quality and organic revenue tracking.",
  },
  {
    question: "How often should an SEO audit be completed?",
    answer:
      "A full audit is useful before major SEO investment, redesigns, migrations, platform changes or recovery work. Ongoing websites also benefit from periodic focused audits when performance changes, templates are updated or new sections are launched.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do you prioritise audit findings?",
    answer:
      "Findings are prioritised using business importance, SEO impact, affected scale, implementation effort, dependencies and risk. This prevents minor warnings from receiving the same attention as issues blocking valuable pages or entire templates.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can an SEO audit guarantee ranking improvements?",
    answer:
      "No audit can guarantee rankings. An audit reduces uncertainty by identifying technical, content and authority constraints, but results depend on implementation quality, competition, content value, authority, search demand and ongoing optimisation.",
