    question: "What is included in your link building SEO service?",

      "The scope can include backlink and competitor analysis, target-page planning, linkable-asset strategy, prospect research, opportunity qualification, personalised outreach, digital PR, expert contributions, placement verification and campaign reporting. The exact mix depends on your market, current authority and available assets.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you guarantee a fixed number of backlinks?",
    answer:
      "We do not promise artificial quantities or guaranteed placements because genuine editorial links depend on relevance, publisher decisions and campaign quality. We agree on activity, qualification standards, outreach scope and reporting, then focus on earning links that can withstand scrutiny.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do you judge whether a backlink is high quality?",
    answer:
      "We assess topical relevance, editorial context, organic visibility, publishing standards, audience fit, page quality, placement position and risk signals. Third-party authority metrics can support the review, but they are never used as the only quality test.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you use paid links or private blog networks?",
    answer:
      "No. We do not use private blog networks, disguised link farms or bulk packages designed to manipulate authority. Where a legitimate publication has sponsorship or contributor policies, any commercial arrangement must be transparent, relevant and handled according to search-engine guidelines.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can you build links directly to service or product pages?",
    answer:
      "Sometimes, but direct commercial-page links are harder to earn and must make editorial sense. We often combine selective direct opportunities with supporting guides, research, tools or resources that attract links and internally strengthen the relevant commercial pages.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long does link building take to produce results?",
    answer:
      "Prospecting and outreach can begin early, but placements and search impact usually develop over several months. Timing varies with market competition, brand credibility, asset quality, publisher response cycles, website condition and how closely link building is integrated with content and technical SEO.",
  },
  {
    question: "What anchor text do you use?",
    answer:
      "Anchor text is kept natural and editorially appropriate. We prioritise brand names, URLs, topical phrases and contextual wording rather than forcing exact-match commercial anchors. Existing anchor distribution and risk are reviewed before recommendations are made.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can you recover lost or broken backlinks?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Link reclamation can include finding lost links, correcting broken destination URLs, restoring removed resources, consolidating redirected pages and contacting publishers when a valuable link can reasonably be recovered or updated.",
  },
  {
    question: "How is link building performance reported?",
    answer:
      "Reporting can cover qualified prospects, outreach activity, responses, live and pending placements, link quality, target pages, anchors, referral traffic, lost links and search visibility trends. We separate completed activity from earned outcomes so the campaign remains transparent.",

                Link building starts with understanding why competitors are
                trusted, which pages attract citations and where your own
