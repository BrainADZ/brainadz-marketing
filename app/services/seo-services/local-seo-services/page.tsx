  {
    question: "What is included in your Local SEO service?",

      "A Local SEO engagement can include Google Business Profile optimization, local keyword research, location-page optimization, citation and NAP management, review workflow support, local authority building, structured data, tracking and monthly reporting. The final scope depends on your locations, business model, website condition and target markets.",
  },
  {
    question: "How is Local SEO different from regular SEO?",
    answer:
      "Local SEO focuses on searches with geographic intent and includes signals beyond the website, especially Google Business Profile, map results, proximity, citations, reviews and branch-level information. Regular SEO can target broader informational or national demand without the same location-specific requirements.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can Local SEO guarantee a top-three Google Maps ranking?",
    answer:
      "No responsible agency can guarantee a fixed map-pack position. Local results vary by searcher location, relevance, competition, prominence and Google updates. We improve the signals, coverage and conversion readiness you can control and report progress transparently.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long does Local SEO take to show results?",
    answer:
      "Critical profile, NAP and website corrections can improve visibility early, while competitive map rankings, review growth and authority usually require sustained work. Timing depends on your current condition, market competition, location, website strength and implementation speed.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you optimize Google Business Profile listings?",
    answer:
      "Yes. We review categories, services, products, descriptions, hours, attributes, media, posts, Q&A, landing-page links, duplicate risks and ongoing profile hygiene. Any ownership, verification or reinstatement action that requires the business owner is coordinated with your team.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you create pages for every city we serve?",
    answer:
      "Only when a page serves a genuine user need and can contain unique, useful local information. We avoid mass-producing thin city pages. The strategy may use priority service-area pages, strong core service pages or branch pages depending on eligibility, coverage and search demand.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do you handle Local SEO for multiple locations?",
    answer:
      "We create a scalable framework for profile governance, branch data, location-page structure, unique content, internal linking, citations, reviews and reporting. Each eligible location needs distinct information and performance visibility without weakening the overall brand architecture.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can you remove negative Google reviews?",
    answer:
      "We cannot remove legitimate reviews or promise removal. We can help identify reviews that may violate platform policies, organize a professional response process and improve the broader review system so future customers see a balanced and credible reputation.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do you measure Local SEO performance?",
    answer:
      "We measure map-pack and local organic visibility together with Google Business Profile actions, calls, website clicks, form submissions, direction requests where relevant and qualified enquiries. Reporting focuses on whether stronger local visibility is producing useful business activity.",
