      "The scope can include footage review, clip selection, hook development, trimming, pacing, B-roll, captions, transitions, music, sound effects, branded graphics, cover design, CTA frames and final Reel exports. The exact mix depends on the content objective and source material.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can you edit Reels from raw mobile footage?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Mobile footage can work well when it is clearly recorded, properly lit and supported by usable audio. We review the files first and recommend an edit direction that matches the available quality and coverage.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you edit talking-head and founder Reels?",
    answer:
      "Yes. We can tighten dialogue, remove unnecessary pauses, add jump cuts, B-roll, punch-ins, captions and brand graphics while keeping the delivery natural and credible.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can you create product and promotional Reels?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Product Reels can include feature demonstrations, close-ups, benefit callouts, comparisons, offer messaging, campaign variations and CTA end frames using footage supplied by your team or created through an agreed production scope.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you follow trending Reel formats and audio?",
    answer:
      "We can adapt relevant formats and audio patterns when they suit the brand and campaign. Trend use is selective because clarity, legal usage, audience relevance and brand consistency remain more important than copying every popular format.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can you manage a monthly volume of Reels?",
    answer:
      "Yes. For ongoing production, we can create a structured workflow covering content themes, batch footage, approved edit styles, review cycles, covers, file naming and calendar-ready delivery. The monthly volume is finalized according to footage and complexity.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you add captions, music and sound effects?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Caption styling, music, sound effects and basic audio balancing can be included. Licensed music, custom voice-over, advanced sound restoration or original audio production are scoped separately when required.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can one Reel be adapted for Facebook or ads?",
    answer:
      "Yes. A master Reel can be adapted for Instagram, Facebook and compatible Meta ad placements. Hook, duration, CTA, safe-zone and offer variations can also be prepared when included in the campaign scope.",
  },
  {
    question: "How many revisions are included?",
    answer:
      "The number of revision rounds is agreed before work begins. Consolidated feedback is recommended so messaging, pacing and visual changes remain clear across every Reel and version.",
  },
  {
    question: "Will I receive editable project files?",
    answer:
      "Editable project files can be included when agreed in advance and when third-party assets, fonts or plugins allow transfer. Final publishing-ready Reel files are delivered as standard.",
