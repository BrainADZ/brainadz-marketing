  },
  {
    question: "Do you create both static and video ad creatives?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Static advertising is covered directly within this service. Motion graphics, animated banners and edited video ads can also be included when the campaign requires them, with the animation or editing scope planned separately according to duration and complexity.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can you create ads for Meta, LinkedIn, Google and other platforms?",
    answer:
      "Yes. We can prepare creatives for Meta placements, LinkedIn campaigns, Google display requirements, YouTube support graphics, marketplace promotions and other planned media environments. Final dimensions and file specifications are confirmed before production.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you provide multiple ad variations for testing?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Variation sets can test hooks, visuals, benefits, offers, proof points and calls to action. We recommend defining the test logic before design so each variation produces more useful campaign learning.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can you work with copy supplied by our performance marketing team?",
    answer:
      "Yes. We can design from approved copy, refine the hierarchy of supplied copy or collaborate with your media and marketing teams on multiple headline and CTA versions. Final claims, prices and legal statements remain subject to client approval.",
  },
  {
    question: "Will the ad creatives follow our brand guidelines?",
    answer:
      "Yes. We use the approved logo, colors, typography, imagery rules and campaign assets while adapting the execution for advertising speed and placement requirements. When formal guidelines are unavailable, we first establish a practical campaign visual direction.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you guarantee campaign performance or conversions?",
    answer:
      "No responsible design partner can guarantee a specific result because performance also depends on the offer, targeting, budget, bidding, landing page, competition and sales process. Our role is to create clear, relevant and testable advertising assets that support better campaign execution.",
  },
  {
    question: "How quickly can an ad creative project be completed?",
    answer:
      "Timelines depend on the number of concepts, formats, variations, content readiness, product-image requirements and review cycles. A small approved campaign set can move quickly, while a multi-platform testing system requires more structured production time.",
