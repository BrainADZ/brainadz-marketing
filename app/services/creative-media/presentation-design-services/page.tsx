const FAQS = [
  {
    question: "What is included in presentation design services?",
    answer:
      "The scope can include content review, deck restructuring, visual direction, slide design, chart and diagram redesign, image treatment, branded layouts, animation guidance, editable presentation delivery and reusable master slides. The exact mix depends on whether you need a new presentation, redesign or template system.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can you redesign an existing PowerPoint presentation?",
    answer:
      "Yes. We can improve an existing deck by restructuring the flow, simplifying slides, strengthening hierarchy, updating visuals and applying a consistent design system. The original content can be retained, edited or reorganized according to the agreed scope.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you help with presentation content and storytelling?",
    answer:
      "Yes. We can organize content, improve slide headlines, reduce repetition and recommend a clearer narrative sequence. Full copywriting, detailed research or financial modeling can be scoped separately when the presentation requires substantial new content development.",
  },
  {
    question: "Which presentation formats do you work with?",
    answer:
      "Presentations can be designed for Microsoft PowerPoint, Google Slides or PDF delivery. Final format decisions depend on how your team edits, presents and shares the deck. Keynote compatibility or other specific requirements should be confirmed before production begins.",
  },
  {
    question: "Will the final presentation be editable?",
    answer:
      "Editable delivery can be included. Text, charts, tables and approved layout components are organized for practical updates, although certain custom graphics or image-based treatments may remain as placed visual assets. Editable requirements are confirmed at the start of the project.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can you create charts, diagrams and infographics for the deck?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Raw data, tables, processes and frameworks can be converted into charts, diagrams, timelines, comparisons and infographic-style slides. Data accuracy remains dependent on the final information supplied and approved by your team.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you create reusable PowerPoint templates?",
    answer:
      "Yes. We can create a branded master presentation with reusable cover, section, content, image, chart, comparison, case-study and closing layouts. Templates are built around the recurring presentation needs of your team rather than providing a large set of unnecessary slide variations.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long does a presentation design project take?",
    answer:
      "Timelines depend on slide count, content readiness, complexity of charts and diagrams, number of stakeholders and review cycles. A visual redesign of finalized content usually moves faster than a presentation requiring restructuring, new copy and extensive data visualization.",
  },
