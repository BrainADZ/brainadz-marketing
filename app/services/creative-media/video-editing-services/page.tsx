  {

    answer:
      "We edit YouTube videos, interviews, podcasts, product demonstrations, promotional films, campaign videos, event highlights and multi-platform cutdowns. The exact approach depends on the footage, audience, duration and communication objective.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can you edit footage recorded by our internal team?",
    answer:
      "Yes. We regularly work with footage recorded by internal teams, creators, production partners and event crews. Before starting, we review the available files to identify any quality, continuity, audio or coverage limitations that may affect the final edit.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you provide scriptwriting or only editing?",
    answer:
      "We can work from your finished script or help organize an outline, narrative structure, voice-over flow and on-screen messaging. Full script development can be included when it is required by the project scope.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can you add subtitles, titles and motion graphics?",
    answer:
      "Yes. The edit can include subtitles, lower thirds, opening titles, product callouts, animated text, logo motion and simple explainer graphics. More complex animation or 3D production is scoped separately when required.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you improve poor-quality footage or audio?",
    answer:
      "We can improve many common issues through exposure correction, shot matching, stabilization, dialogue cleanup and audio balancing. However, severely blurred, clipped, noisy or missing material cannot always be fully restored, so limitations are flagged during footage review.",
  },
  {
    question: "How does the revision process work?",
    answer:
      "The project follows defined review stages, usually beginning with the rough cut and then moving to finishing. Consolidated, time-coded feedback helps revisions stay accurate and prevents conflicting comments from slowing the workflow.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can one video be adapted for different platforms?",
    answer:
      "Yes. An approved master can be adapted into landscape, square, vertical or shorter versions when the original composition and footage support those formats. Important text and subjects are repositioned rather than simply cropped.",
  },
  {
    question: "What files do you need to begin?",
    answer:
      "We typically need the raw footage, script or brief, logo and brand assets, preferred references, music or voice-over files when available, and the required duration, platform, ratio and deadline. We provide a clear intake checklist before production starts.",
  },

                Video editing is not only about shortening clips or adding
                transitions. BrainADZ reviews the footage, identifies the strongest
                narrative and builds a complete post-production system around the
                audience, platform and business objective. The result is a video
                that feels intentional from the first frame to the final action.
