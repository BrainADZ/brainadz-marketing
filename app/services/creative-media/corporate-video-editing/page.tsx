  },
  {
    question: "Can you work with footage recorded by different teams or vendors?",
    answer:
      "Yes. We can combine footage from internal teams, professional crews, event vendors, phones, video calls and archives. We first audit resolution, frame rate, audio, continuity and usage rights so limitations are clear before the edit begins.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can you help structure the script and corporate narrative?",
    answer:
      "Yes. We can organize approved talking points, interview responses and supporting facts into a clearer narrative. Full scriptwriting, interview planning or production direction can also be scoped when the project requires them.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do you manage feedback from multiple stakeholders?",
    answer:
      "We define decision-makers and review stages at the start, then request one consolidated set of time-coded comments per round. This reduces conflicting feedback and keeps message, compliance and creative approvals synchronized.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can confidential corporate footage be handled securely?",
    answer:
      "Confidentiality requirements, file access and restricted assets should be identified during intake. We can work within an agreed handover and review process, and project-specific confidentiality documentation can be arranged where required.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you create captions and multilingual versions?",
    answer:
      "Yes. We can prepare subtitles, burned-in captions, translated on-screen graphics and localized masters using approved transcripts or translations supplied or validated by your team. Language accuracy remains part of the approval process.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can one corporate video be adapted for different channels?",
    answer:
      "Yes. An approved master can be adapted for websites, presentations, LinkedIn, YouTube, internal portals, event screens and shorter campaign placements when the original composition and content support those versions.",
  },
  {
    question: "What do you need before starting the edit?",
    answer:
      "We typically need the communication brief, audience, approved script or talking points, raw footage, brand guidelines, logos, names and titles, required claims or disclaimers, reference videos, language needs, target duration, formats and deadline.",
