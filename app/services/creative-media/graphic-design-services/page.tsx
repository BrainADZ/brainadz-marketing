    question: "What is included in your graphic design service?",

      "The scope can include concept development, layout design, typography, image treatment, brand alignment, revisions and final file preparation. The exact deliverables depend on whether the requirement is for social media, digital campaigns, print, presentations, packaging or corporate communication.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can you follow our existing brand guidelines?",
    answer:
      "Yes. We can work within your existing logo, color, typography and layout guidelines. When formal guidelines are not available, we can review existing brand material and establish a practical visual direction before beginning the project.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you provide designs for both digital and print use?",
    answer:
      "Yes. We create digital assets for websites, advertising and social platforms, as well as print-ready artwork for brochures, catalogues, packaging, signage, standees and exhibition graphics. Each file is prepared according to the required dimensions and output specifications.",
  },
  {
    question: "How many revisions are included?",
    answer:
      "Revision terms are finalized with the project scope. Most projects include a defined number of consolidated review cycles. Additional changes, new concepts or major changes to approved content can be scoped separately when required.",
  },
  {
    question: "What files will we receive after approval?",
    answer:
      "Final delivery can include JPG, PNG, PDF or other required export formats. Editable source files can also be included when agreed in the project scope. Print projects are supplied in the correct size, resolution and color setup for production.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can you manage monthly graphic design requirements?",
    answer:
      "Yes. We support ongoing monthly requirements for social content, campaign creatives, presentations, sales material and other recurring design needs. A monthly workflow helps maintain consistency, priorities and faster approvals.",
  },
  {
    question: "How quickly can you complete a design project?",
    answer:
      "Timelines depend on the number of deliverables, complexity, content readiness and review cycles. Simple creatives can move quickly, while brochures, presentations, packaging or large campaigns require more planning and production time.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can you create content as well as the design?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Copywriting, content structuring, campaign messaging and creative direction can be included when required. This helps ensure the design and message work together instead of being developed separately.",
