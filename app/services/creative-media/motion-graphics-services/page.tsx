const FAQS = [
  {
    question: "What is included in your motion graphics service?",
    answer:
      "The scope can include concept development, script support, storyboard, styleframes, 2D motion design, kinetic typography, logo animation, transitions, graphic overlays, sound synchronization, revisions and platform-specific exports. The exact production scope is defined around the communication objective and available source material.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you write the script and storyboard as well?",
    answer:
      "Yes. We can develop the full visual structure from a brief or work with an approved script supplied by your team. For larger explainers, scriptwriting, voice-over and detailed storyboard requirements are scoped before animation begins.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can you animate our existing brand designs?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Existing logos, campaign creatives, illustrations, presentation graphics, product visuals and brand assets can be adapted into motion. We first review whether the source files have the layers and resolution needed for clean animation.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you create 2D or 3D motion graphics?",
    answer:
      "Our primary scope covers 2D motion graphics, typography, compositing, graphic transitions and interface-style animation. Selected 3D product or environmental requirements can be planned separately depending on model availability, realism, duration and rendering complexity.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long does a motion graphics project take?",
    answer:
      "Timelines depend on duration, number of scenes, illustration requirements, audio, complexity and review speed. A short social animation may move quickly, while a detailed explainer requires separate scripting, storyboard, design, animation and approval stages.",
  },
  {
    question: "How many revision rounds are included?",
    answer:
      "Revision rounds are defined in the agreed scope. Feedback is most efficient when it is consolidated by stage—script and storyboard first, visual direction second, then animation—because structural changes after full animation can affect the timeline and cost.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can one animation be resized for different platforms?",
    answer:
      "Yes. We can plan a master animation and create vertical, square, portrait or landscape adaptations. Some scenes may need recomposition rather than simple cropping so text, products and focal points remain clear in every ratio.",
  },
  {
    question: "Which final files will we receive?",
    answer:
      "Final files can include MP4, MOV, transparent-background video, GIF or image sequences where required. Resolution, frame rate, codec, duration, ratio and editable source-file handover are confirmed in the project scope.",
  },
