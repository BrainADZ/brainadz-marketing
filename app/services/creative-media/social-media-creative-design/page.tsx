const FAQS = [
  {
    question: "What is included in social media creative design services?",
    answer:
      "The scope can include static posts, carousels, stories, reel covers, video support graphics, campaign adaptations, paid-social creatives, profile assets and reusable template systems. The final mix depends on your platforms, publishing volume, campaign plan and internal content workflow.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you also write the content and captions?",
    answer:
      "Creative design can be provided from client-approved copy, or the scope can include content planning and copywriting support. When copy is included, headlines, slide flow, on-creative text and calls to action are developed together with the visual concept.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can you follow our existing brand guidelines?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Existing logo, color, typography, imagery and layout rules are reviewed before design begins. We can work strictly within established guidelines or develop a social-first extension when the current system does not cover recurring digital content needs.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you design monthly social media content packages?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Monthly production can be organized around an approved calendar, content pillars and defined format mix. The workflow can include batches of posts, carousels, stories, covers and campaign adaptations with a scheduled review and delivery cycle.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can you resize one creative for multiple platforms?",
    answer:
      "Yes. A master creative can be adapted for different aspect ratios, placements and channels. Adaptation is more than automatic resizing: hierarchy, cropping, text scale and interface-safe areas are adjusted so the message remains clear in each format.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you provide editable source files?",
    answer:
      "Editable files can be included when agreed in the project scope. The format depends on the software and template requirements. Final publishing files are normally delivered in optimized image or document formats, with organized naming for easy use by the publishing team.",
  },
  {
    question: "How are revisions handled?",
    answer:
      "Feedback is collected in consolidated review rounds against the approved brief and direction. This keeps revisions efficient and prevents conflicting changes across a complete content set. The number of rounds and turnaround expectations are defined before production starts.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can you create ad creatives for testing different messages?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Paid-social creative sets can include variations in headline, offer, visual, proof point, call to action, audience angle and format. The testing matrix should be planned with the media objective so the variations produce useful performance learning rather than cosmetic differences.",
  },
