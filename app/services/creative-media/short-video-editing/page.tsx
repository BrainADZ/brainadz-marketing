const FAQS = [

    question: "What is included in short video editing?",

      "The scope can include footage review, clip selection, trimming, pacing, captions, B-roll, transitions, music, sound effects, motion graphics, brand elements, CTA frames and final platform exports. The exact combination depends on the source footage and content objective.",
  },
  {
    question: "Which short video platforms do you edit for?",
    answer:
      "We can prepare content for Instagram Reels, YouTube Shorts, Facebook, LinkedIn and paid social placements. One master edit can also be adapted into multiple platform versions when the content and safe-zone requirements allow it.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can you edit videos from raw mobile footage?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Mobile footage can work well when it is clearly recorded, properly lit and supported by usable audio. We review the files first and recommend the most practical edit direction based on their quality and coverage.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you add captions, music and sound effects?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Caption design, music, sound effects and basic audio balancing can be included. Licensed music requirements, custom voice-over or advanced audio restoration are scoped separately when needed.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can you turn long videos into Reels and Shorts?",
    answer:
      "Yes. We can review podcasts, interviews, webinars, event footage and long-form videos to identify useful moments, rebuild them with short-form context and deliver a series of focused clips.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you create different hooks for video ads?",
    answer:
      "Yes. For performance campaigns, we can develop multiple opening hooks, order changes, CTA treatments or product-led variations using the available footage. The number of versions is defined in the project scope.",
  },
  {
    question: "How should I send footage and brand assets?",
    answer:
      "You can share organized footage, logos, fonts, brand guidelines, reference links, scripts and publishing notes through a shared drive or agreed file-transfer method. Clear file names and a concise brief help the edit move faster.",
  },
  {
    question: "How many revisions are included?",
    answer:
      "The number of revision rounds is agreed before work begins. Consolidated feedback is recommended so changes remain clear and the approved structure is not repeatedly rebuilt across separate comments.",
  },
  {
    question: "Will I receive editable project files?",
    answer:
      "Editable project files can be included when agreed in advance and when third-party assets or plugins allow transfer. Final publishing files are delivered in the required resolution, ratio and format as standard.",
