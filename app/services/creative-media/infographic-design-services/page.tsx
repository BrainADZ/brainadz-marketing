const FAQS = [
  {
    question: "What is included in your infographic design service?",
    answer:
      "The scope can include content review, information hierarchy, wireframing, chart and diagram selection, icon or illustration styling, branded visual design, revisions, format adaptations and final exports. The exact deliverables depend on the length, complexity and intended use of the infographic.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you write and research the infographic content?",
    answer:
      "We can help organise, shorten and structure client-supplied content. Research and long-form copy development can also be scoped separately when required. Final statistics, claims, citations and source accuracy remain subject to client review and approval.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can you design charts and graphs from our data?",
    answer:
      "Yes. We can convert approved spreadsheets, reports and data tables into charts, graphs and visual summaries. The supplied data should be final, clearly labelled and accompanied by the relevant units, time periods and source notes.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can one infographic be adapted for social media and print?",
    answer:
      "Yes. We can create a master visual and then rebuild it for social posts, carousels, stories, presentation slides, web pages and print. Adaptation is planned separately because each format requires different proportions, text density and reading behaviour.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you provide editable infographic files?",
    answer:
      "Editable files can be included when agreed in the project scope. Depending on the design, delivery may include Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop, PowerPoint or another suitable editable format along with ready-to-use PNG, JPG or PDF exports.",
  },
  {
    question: "Will the design follow our brand guidelines?",
    answer:
      "Yes. We use your approved logo, colours, typography, icon style and imagery rules. When formal guidelines are unavailable, we establish a practical visual direction based on your existing brand materials before developing the complete infographic.",
  },
  {
    question: "How many revisions are included?",
    answer:
      "The number of review rounds is defined in the project scope. Revisions generally cover hierarchy, wording, colours, visual treatment and approved data corrections. Major changes to the content or structure after design approval may require a revised scope.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long does an infographic design project take?",
    answer:
      "Timelines depend on the amount of information, data readiness, chart complexity, illustration requirements, number of formats and review speed. A focused single infographic can move quickly, while research-heavy or multi-page infographic systems need a more structured schedule.",
