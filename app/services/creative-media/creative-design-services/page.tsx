const FAQS = [
  {
    question: "What is included in creative design services?",
    answer:
      "Creative design services can include concept development, campaign themes, message hierarchy, art direction, key visual creation, social and digital adaptations, visual storytelling and final production files. The exact scope is finalized around the communication objective and required channels.",
  },
  {
    question: "How is creative design different from regular graphic design?",
    answer:
      "Graphic design often focuses on producing a defined visual asset, while creative design also develops the central idea, storytelling approach and visual direction behind a campaign. A creative design engagement can therefore begin before the layout stage and guide multiple deliverables through one connected concept.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can you develop a complete campaign concept?",
    answer:
      "Yes. We can develop the campaign theme, communication angle, key message, visual territory, master creative and channel adaptations. Copywriting, campaign planning, motion assets or production support can also be coordinated when included in the scope.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can you work with our existing brand guidelines?",
    answer:
      "Yes. We can create new campaign ideas within an established brand system, including existing typography, colors, imagery and design rules. When guidelines allow flexibility, we can also introduce campaign-specific devices without weakening brand recognition.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you create one master design for multiple platforms?",
    answer:
      "Yes. We usually establish a master creative or key visual first, then adapt it to the dimensions, content hierarchy and behavior of each required platform. This keeps the campaign connected while avoiding simple resizing that ignores format differences.",
  },
  {
    question: "How many creative concepts do you present?",
    answer:
      "The number of routes depends on the scope, complexity and agreed process. Some assignments need one focused direction developed from a clear brief, while larger campaigns may include multiple concept territories before one route is selected for development.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can you support recurring monthly creative needs?",
    answer:
      "Yes. The monthly creative desk model supports recurring social, campaign, sales and brand communication requirements. Priorities, expected volumes, review cycles and delivery rhythm are defined at the beginning of the engagement.",
  },
  {
    question: "What files are delivered after approval?",
    answer:
      "Final assets can be supplied as JPG, PNG, PDF or other required publishing formats. Editable source files, print-ready files or organized campaign packages can be included when specified in the project scope.",
  },
