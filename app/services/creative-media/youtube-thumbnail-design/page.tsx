const FAQS = [
  {
    question: "What do you need to design a YouTube thumbnail?",
    answer:
      "We usually need the video topic, working title, target audience, key message, preferred visual direction, brand references and the best available images or video stills. When the title is not final, we can still design around the strongest content promise.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can you design thumbnails without a professional photoshoot?",
    answer:
      "Yes. We can work with supplied photographs, video stills, product images, screenshots and suitable brand assets. The final result depends on the quality and relevance of the source material, so we identify any limitations before production.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you create YouTube Shorts covers as well?",
    answer:
      "Yes. We can design vertical cover assets for Shorts and recurring short-form series. The composition is adapted for the 9:16 format and checked for safe placement across channel and mobile views.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can you create multiple thumbnail options for one video?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Multiple directions can be scoped for important uploads, campaigns or structured testing. Variants may explore different hooks, subject images, text treatments, background approaches or compositions while staying aligned with the same video.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you help with title and thumbnail alignment?",
    answer:
      "Yes. We review the relationship between the title and visual so they complement one another. The thumbnail should add a fast visual promise rather than simply repeating the complete title as text.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can you create a consistent thumbnail style for our channel?",
    answer:
      "Yes. We can define typography, colors, layout logic, image treatment, recurring labels and series-specific rules to make the channel recognizable while keeping enough variation between individual videos.",
  },
  {
    question: "Are editable source files included?",
    answer:
      "Editable files can be included when agreed in the project scope. We also provide final upload-ready exports and can organize templates or series files for teams that publish content regularly.",
  },
  {
    question: "How quickly can a thumbnail be delivered?",
    answer:
      "Turnaround depends on the volume, source material, number of concepts and review cycle. Recurring thumbnail workflows can usually move faster once the channel style, approval process and asset system are established.",
  },
