const FAQS = [
  {
    question: "What is included in branding design services?",
    answer:
      "The scope can include brand discovery, logo design, responsive logo versions, color and typography systems, supporting graphic language, imagery direction, priority applications, brand guidelines and a structured final asset package. The exact deliverables depend on whether the requirement is a new identity, refresh or complete rebrand.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is branding design only about creating a logo?",
    answer:
      "No. A logo is one important identifier, but a usable brand identity also needs typography, colors, imagery, layouts, graphic devices, application rules and consistent production standards. These elements work together to create recognition across different customer touchpoints.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can you refresh our existing brand without changing everything?",
    answer:
      "Yes. An identity refresh can retain recognizable assets while improving typography, color, proportions, supporting graphics and application consistency. We first identify which elements still carry useful brand equity before recommending an evolutionary refresh or a more substantial redesign.",
  },
  {
    question: "How many logo concepts do you provide?",
    answer:
      "The concept approach is defined in the project scope. We prioritize a focused set of strategically relevant directions rather than producing many disconnected options. Each presented route includes the design rationale and enough application context to evaluate its potential as a complete identity.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you provide editable and vector logo files?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Final approved logo assets can be supplied in vector and publishing formats such as AI, EPS, SVG, PDF, PNG and JPG. The package can include RGB, CMYK, monochrome, reversed and responsive variants according to the agreed scope.",
  },
  {
    question: "Will we receive brand guidelines?",
    answer:
      "Brand guidelines can be included as a core project deliverable. They typically document logo usage, clear space, minimum size, colors, typography, imagery, graphic elements, layouts and misuse examples. The depth of the document depends on the size and complexity of the identity system.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can you apply the new identity to our existing materials?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Priority rollout assets can include stationery, presentations, company profiles, social templates, campaign formats, packaging direction, signage and exhibition communication. The application list is finalized according to launch priorities and production requirements.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long does a branding design project take?",
    answer:
      "Timelines vary with discovery depth, decision-making, number of stakeholders, identity complexity and rollout scope. A focused identity refresh may move faster than a full rebrand involving research, multiple applications and detailed guidelines. The project schedule is agreed after the scope and review process are defined.",
