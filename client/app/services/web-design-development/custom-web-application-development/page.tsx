const FAQS = [
  {
    question:
      "What is included in custom web application development?",

      "The service can include requirement analysis, application architecture, UI development, backend development, databases, user authentication, role management, dashboards, API integrations, testing, deployment and post-launch support.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "What types of custom web applications do you develop?",
    answer:
      "We develop customer portals, admin panels, workflow systems, SaaS platforms, dashboards, internal management systems and other browser-based applications.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "How is a custom web application different from a website?",
    answer:
      "A website mainly presents information and supports basic interactions. A web application usually includes user accounts, data processing, dashboards, workflows, permissions and business-specific functionality.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "Can you automate our existing manual business process?",
    answer:
      "Yes. We can review spreadsheets, forms, approvals and repetitive activities and convert suitable processes into structured digital workflows.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "Can different users have different access levels?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Role-based access can be configured so administrators, employees, customers, vendors and other users only access relevant modules and actions.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "Can the application integrate with our CRM or ERP?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Integration is possible when the required CRM, ERP or external platform provides suitable APIs, webhooks or supported connection methods.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "Which technologies do you use for web applications?",
    answer:
      "Technology is selected according to the project. Common options include Next.js, React, TypeScript, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, MySQL and PostgreSQL.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "Will the web application work on mobile devices?",
    answer:
      "Yes. The interface can be developed responsively for desktop, tablet and mobile devices. Complex operational applications may still be optimized primarily for larger screens when appropriate.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "Can the application support multiple companies or branches?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Multi-company, multi-branch or multi-tenant structures can be developed when required, with controlled data and user access.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "How long does custom web application development take?",
    answer:
      "Timelines depend on modules, workflows, user roles, integrations and testing complexity. A focused MVP may take several weeks, while a larger platform is usually delivered in phases.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "Can you build an MVP first?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Core features can be prioritized into an MVP so the application can be tested with real users before additional modules are developed.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "Do you provide support after launch?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Post-launch support can include bug fixes, performance monitoring, security updates, user assistance and future feature development.",
